In some cases, caustic ingredients like quicklime and arsenic were used in these primitive depilatory creams and shaving lotions. Early razors also appeared around the time, with the rise in metalworking and mining in many areas of the world. The Egyptian relationship to cleanliness and body hair bordered on the obsessive, and the upper classes often bathed multiple times per day.

While rare, the practice has a legal basis. In 2004, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on public shaming in United States vs. Gementera.\n\n\nA trial judge ruled that Shawn Gementera, who had been convicted of stealing mail, had to stand in front of a post office holding a sign that said, \u201cI stole mail. This is my punishment.\u201d Gementera appealed, claiming the sentence violated the Eighth Amendment constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

As to the use of judicial authority to intimidate defendants into accepting these bizarre castigations, defendants could be informed of their rights before a trial, in the same way that police officers read a person\u2019s Miranda rights before an interrogation.

Other experts think that people with irregular handwriting are eccentric, which was the case with the famed violinist Paganini. He was known for being creative and odd, so he fits into both categories.",

Thunder snow can happen in three different instances. The normal one is when a thunderstorm is on the edge of a cold front or a warm front where the precipitation in the atmosphere takes the form of snow. The second instance is when there is a synoptic snowstorm that allows for conditions that make lightning and thunder to occur, but those are the most rare ones.

They tend to associate vegetables with less positive memories, such as nagging parents and unpleasant meals during which they are forced to eat green stuff.

The sour and bitter flavors alert us to foods that might be toxic or harmful to us.\n\n\nVegetables, although very healthy, do have a component of bitterness to them. This could be from a low level of toxins created by the plant to avoid being eaten, or a kind of bitterness camouflage to make an animal think the plant is toxic.\n\n\nSince children in general have more sensitive taste buds than adults, designed to protect their more sensitive digestive systems, they\u2019re not fond of bitter flavors.

This was the motivation behind the partitions famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed for the influential Larkin Building that stood in Buffalo, New York, from 1903 to 1950. Many of his ideas, like small bathroom doors, became a standard of business construction.\n\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced gaps are a design win, consider that an enclosed stall is going to have only limited air circulation.

Mother dogs will lick their puppies to urge them to eliminate, and clean up their feces by eating it, for about the first three weeks after birth. Puppies will also naturally engage in this behavior, eating both their own poop (autocoprophagia), poop from other dogs (allocoprophagia), as well as poop from cats and other animals.

Eating their own poop is harmless, but consuming poop from other animals may cause health problems if the stool is contaminated with parasites, viruses, or toxins.

A promising approach is to reduce the viscosity of the Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF) so as to minimize churning loss.

It is generally understood that if the viscosity of an ATF is too low, it can have a negative impact on the fatigue life of components such as gears and bearings, and possibly lead to increased wear or seizure. AW-2 was designed to solve these problems via the application of two key technologies. The first is a high performance base oil with a low traction coefficient, which translates to low viscosity under high pressure conditions. This decreases the shear resistance between sliding surfaces under elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) conditions, which contributes in improving the fatigue life of bearings and other components. The second is an ester type base oil with high polarity. It was found that the amount of ester base oil used has a major influence on...",

Dawson believes that androgens, hormones like testosterone related to the development of male sex characteristics, floating around our bodies sometimes randomly hit hair precursor stem cells in our skin.\n\n\nWhen this occurs at the right time, and in the right dosage, the combination may trigger the development of a new hair cell in a mostly hairless part of our bodies, or of a hair cell that produces unusual hair for a given hairy part of the body. In men, time and chance\u2014the law of large numbers\u2014likely account for the emergence of more rogue hairs as we age, especially as testosterone levels tend to drop in older men. In women, massive hormonal shifts due to pregnancy, menopause, or other potential life changes can cause a comparative spike in testosterone, coaxing out more rogue hairs.\n\n\nOther hair researchers doubt that androgens activate stem cells, instead suspecting that they hit existing follicles that",

It has strong influences on several perceptual processes in communication, such as face detection, gender perception and facial expression recognition (for reviews, see Itier and Batty, 2009; Senju and Johnson, 2009; Madipakkam et al., 2015; Schilbach, 2015). Impairments in eye contact are common and might significantly contribute to communication difficulties, e.g. in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Dalton et al., 2005; Pelphrey et al., 2005a), in schizophrenia (Choi et al., 2010; Tso et al., 2012) or in social anxiety disorder (Horley et al., 2003; Schneier et al., 2011).",

As synchrony peaks, eye contact occurs, and synchrony declines, only to recover as eye contact breaks.

This subtle dance of eye contact found in face-to-face communication may be one reason why it often feels more satisfying than conversations on Zoom.",

Two important features characterize eye contact in verbal communication. First, eye contact occurs voluntarily while the partners are listening or talking to each other (Macdonald and Tatler, 2013). Second, eye contact is intermittent and of varying duration (Argyle and Dean, 1965), because communication partners freely and actively fixate on and scan between different regions of the partner\u2019s face. The two salient fixation regions are the eyes and the mouth (Vatikiotis-Bateson et al., 1998; Jack et al., 2009; Lusk and Mitchel, 2016). To our knowledge, currently no study has investigated the neural mechanisms underlying eye contact in scenarios that contain these two major features of eye contact in verbal communication. Thus, the first aim of this study was to identify brain regions and networks involved in eye contact with an approach that simulates eye contact when watching and listening to a speaker talking.",

Theorists have proposed that face preferences may be adaptations for mate choice because attractive traits signal important aspects of mate quality, such as health. Others have argued that they may simply be by-products of the way brains process information. Although often presented as alternatives, I argue that both kinds of selection pressures may have shaped our perceptions of facial beauty.",

If the female-specific features of a female composite face are enhanced, the resulting face is perceived as more attractive than the composite. In particular, smaller than average chin, smaller than average nose and higher than average forehead, all are traits associated with female's attractiveness. These traits have been interpreted as signs of high estrogen/testosterone ratio and therefore cues of high fertility. However, these same traits are also a species-specific characteristic of Homo sapiens that differentiates it from other hominid species. Preference for caricature of human features could represent a relic of species recognition mechanisms. Female preferences for male faces proved to be more variable than male preferences for female faces. Different facial traits are preferred in the choice of short-term and long-term partners. Preference for short term depend on the hormonal status and changes across the menstrual cycle and is influenced by contraceptive hormonal treatment. Psychological factors are also important sources of variance: female preferences correlate with self-perceived attractiveness, status in a relationship and degree of gender-conformity.",

Another study has demonstrated that men's facial masculinity and women's facial femininity are negatively related to self reports of respiratory disease . If health is heritable, then female preferences for masculinity and male preferences for femininity may indeed also reflect the choice of mates with good genes. There is also a link between hormonal profile and face shape. Women with higher circulating oestrogen have more feminine faces , while men with high testosterone have more masculine faces (, but see also ).

Adiposity has also been found to be related to attractiveness18. The association between skin colour, particularly carotenoid-based skin yellowness, and facial attractiveness has been gaining attention only in recent years. Carotenoids are red and yellow pigments that influence our skin colour when consumed through fruits and vegetables. Inter- and intra-individual variation in fruit and vegetable intake correlates with skin yellowness19,20. Skin yellowness is related not only to facial attractiveness21, but also to other attractive traits such as sexual dimorphism22.

We document several potentially adaptive individual differences in human face preferences as well as other factors that may lead to variable preferences (\u00a73). Research on human facial attractiveness has benefited greatly from an evolutionary/biological perspective, both in terms of documenting what traits are likely to be important and in predicting individual variation.

The spontaneous capacity for interpersonal synchrony apparently has its roots in early childhood. Mothers\u2019 and their infants\u2019 rhythmic cycles naturally synchronize with each other. For example, mother and infant\u2019s heart rates become coordinated during free play. The early rise of interpersonal motor coordination suggests that it facilitates social interactions with caregivers by satisfying the need for connection and physical safety.\n\n\nSimple motor synchrony may inspire a sense of unity even between previously unacquainted interactional partners and have vast social consequences, such as heightened feelings of connectedness as well as increased cooperation and compassion. Within the context of romantic relationships, synchrony has long been considered as an indication of successful relationships.",

But this can happen also while walking. When two people are walking down a street and are interacting with each other they tend to synchronize their steps more often than random chance would allow. Like mirroring postures, synchronized walking is normally a sign of friendliness and sociability. It is another example of how deeply and unconsciously we interact with each other. The synchronization can be direct-with the left leg matching the other\u2019s left leg position, or it can be mirrored-with the left leg matching the other\u2019s right leg position. In either case, the walking gait and the contact point will remain in sync, with the same timing.",

However, most studies of joint movement with high ecological validity face the same challenge, namely that conversations between participants might be the main or a partial contributor to the observed social benefits, as conversation is well documented to promote understanding and motor synchronization. We addressed this issue by using a novel paradigm to remove the conversation component and examined how synchrony per se interacted with social impression. Participants were paired to walk side by side in silence (i.e. without conversation) and their social impression toward each other was rated before/after the paired walk. Our results showed that walkers' first impression was positively associated with their step synchronization rate in the silent paired walk.

However, any motorcycle, especially when you corner, puts increased strain on the parts and could lead to wobbling.\n\n\n\u25cf Wheel bearings \u2014 If the bearings get worn out, this could cause lateral axle movement which leads to wobbling.

Some types of sharks, such as the lemon shark, can even detect a scent in a large swimming pool or a substance that is several hundred meters away.\n\n\nBut a shark more than a quarter-mile away won\u2019t smell your blood and decide to make you into a yummy snack.

Smelling underwater is no different, except that the molecules are already dissolved in the seawater.

Water molecules in general are carried to the shark by water currents. If there are no water currents then it is molecular diffusion, the random movement of molecules that disperses the odour away from the source. Diffusion is an extremely slow process as Vince experienced in his ink experiment. In general the travel time of odour depends entirely on the local water velocity. Near the water surface water velocities in the ocean can range between a few centimetres per second on a very calm day and several metres per second in a strong current. In summary, odour can theoretically be detected by a shark in several miles from the source and I would estimate that in the ocean this may take at least one minute to reach the shark at a distance of 100m. More likely it will need between ten and twenty minutes. Finally the shark still needs to get to the source and that would take another 10-100 seconds depending on the swim speed of the shark.

Many colleges launch massive mailing campaigns, sending communications to millions of students, even though they only plan to enroll a few thousand.\n\n\nDon\u2019t take college mail as a sign that your perfect college has found you and is reaching out to you. At least not until you\u2019ve had a chance to explore that college and see if it\u2019s actually a good fit, or just a school that knows your name.",

This pressure may stem from a feeling of gratitude or loyalty towards the college that expressed early interest in their application, leading students to prioritize that institution over others. Consequently, they might disregard factors such as academic programs, campus environment, financial aid packages, or future career prospects when making their final decision. This externally influenced commitment could result in students enrolling in a college that does not fully align with their needs and aspirations, potentially impacting their overall satisfaction and success during their college years.",

Don\u2019t worry, swelling is normal and will die down in a couple of years. Nonetheless, with a sudden affliction of this variety, families will have questions. Let\u2019s diagnose the phenomenon together. Does getting mail from a college mean they are interested in me? No. It means they\u2019re interested in something about your scores or demographics. In the early stages of the admission process (sophomore and early junior years), colleges are just looking to initiate student interest within target groups.

The server then responds to the request, sending an answer to the target\u2019s IP address. This \u201creflection\u201d\u2014using the same protocol in both directions\u2014is why this is called a reflection attack. Any server operating UDP- or TCP-based services can be targeted as a reflector.\n* Amplification attacks generate a high volume of packets that are used to overwhelm the target website without alerting the intermediary. This occurs when a vulnerable service responds with a large reply when the attacker sends his request, often called the trigger packet. Using readily available tools, the attacker can send many thousands of these requests to vulnerable services, thereby causing responses that are considerably larger than the original request and significantly amplifying the size and bandwidth issued to the target. The amplification can include multiple response packets to a single",

For example, if a pitcher applies pine tar or vaseline to the ball, it can make the ball more slippery, which can make it more difficult for the hitter to get a good grip on the bat and hit the ball with power. Similarly, if a pitcher applies crisco or some other type of lubricant to the ball, it can make the ball move differently through the air, which can make it more difficult for the hitter to accurately predict where the ball is going to go.",

Perhaps another similarity in the complex process which brought the downfall of other empires is the general disregard of rulers for the resources at their disposal and the long-term welfare of the people they ruled. Was this also the case with the Maya? The period prior to the Maya collapse is certainly characterised by extravagant building projects, unproductive wars, and over-exploitation of natural resources, especially land, forests, and water. An ever increasing population may well have driven the Maya to deforest areas which were subsequently eroded. One case which points to the running out of resources is the curious change in wood used in Maya buildings. Sapodilla was the architect's choice prior to the 740s for such details as lintels but was then replaced by the inferior wood of the smaller logwood tree.

At the same time, osteoclasts in the endosteum break down bone on the internal bone surface, around the medullary cavity. These two processes together increase the diameter of the bone and, at the same time, keep the bone from becoming excessively heavy and bulky.",

Osteoblasts move in and ossify the matrix to form bone. This process continues throughout childhood and the adolescent years until the cartilage growth slows and finally stops. When cartilage growth ceases, usually in the early twenties, the epiphyseal plate completely ossifies so that only a thin epiphyseal line remains and the bones can no longer grow in length. Bone growth is under the influence of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland and sex hormones from the ovaries and testes.",

The osteoblasts form a collar of compact bone around the diaphysis. At the same time, the cartilage in the center of the diaphysis begins to disintegrate. Osteoblasts penetrate the disintegrating cartilage and replace it with spongy bone. This forms a primary ossification center. Ossification continues from this center toward the ends of the bones.

In a vacuum, such as outer space, light travels at a constant speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 186,282 miles per second), which is often rounded to 300,000 kilometers per second for simplicity. This speed is commonly referred to as the speed of light in a vacuum and is denoted by the symbol \"c\". However, when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass, its speed can change. This change in speed is due to the interaction of light with the atoms or molecules in the medium. The speed of light in a medium is typically slower than its speed in a vacuum because the particles in the medium can absorb and re-emit photons, causing a delay in the overall propagation of light. The change in speed of light in different materials is characterized by the refractive index of the material. The refractive index indicates how much the speed of light is reduced when it passes through that particular material compared to its speed in a vacuum.

Because the Julian calendar has a leap year every four years, it was gradually shifting out of alignment with the actual solar year. In fact, the Julian calendar gets out of sync with the Earth's orbit by around one day every century. This is because the Julian calendar assumes that a year is 365.25 days long, when in fact, it is just over 365.24 days. As the Julian calendar shifted, it lost its alignment with the solstices and equinoxes. Because Christian holidays, particularly Easter, rely on the spring equinox and other solar landmarks, this shift grew troublesome for the Catholic Church. The high degree of accuracy that the Gregorian calendar demonstrates has made it a good option for use around the world, including in secular societies. While other calendars remain in use today, the Gregorian calendar is considered the international standard.",

To recoup the drift from the Julian calendar, October 4th of 1582 was directly followed by October 15th; ten days of the month were simply removed to make the calendar shift function. October was chosen as the sacrificial month for the calendar shift because there were relatively few Christian holidays in that month that the shift could disrupt. The first countries to make the shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar were Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and France in 1582. Other countries followed: Austria made the shift in 1583, Hungary in 1587, and Prussia in 1610.",

Orthodox Christians still use the Julian calendar today, which is why Orthodox Christmas is celebrated on January 7th of the Gregorian calendar.

New houses were built on top of the ruins of old ones because hauling away rubble was labour intensive and it was much easier to simply spread it out and build straight on top.\n\n\nRivers periodically flooded and added a layer of silt, while in dry regions the wind was constantly blowing in sand and dust. (The Sphinx was buried up to its head in sand until archaeologists re-excavated it in 1817.)\n\n\nWhen ancient towns were abandoned entirely, plant seeds quickly took root and created more bulk from the CO_2 they pulled from the air. Their roots stabilised the soil created from rotting plant matter and the layers gradually built up.",

One common way that ancient structures and artifacts can become buried is through natural processes such as erosion, which can cause soil and other materials to shift and cover up these remains over time. This can occur due to wind, water, or other forces of nature that cause the movement of soil and other materials. In other cases, ancient structures and artifacts may become buried as a result of geological events such as earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions, which can also cause soil and other materials to shift and cover up these remains. Finally, ancient civilizations may also become buried intentionally as part of cultural practices, such as the burial of tombs or other structures.",

As their breeding zones moved north during periods of glacial retreat, the birds continued to return to their tropical homes as winter weather and declining food supplies made life more difficult.

Iced coffee is brewed as regular coffee, which then goes through a cooling process and is served over ice. Cold brew, on the other hand, is created by steeping ground coffee at room temperature and then filtering out the grounds. So, it\u2019s essentially the most concentrated version of coffee you can get. Once you filter out the grounds, the concentrate is combined with water for (generally) a 50/50 coffee concentrate/water split, and TA-DA! You have cold brew.",

Of course, there will be less in your cup to accommodate for the space that ice takes up \u2014 so overall, you may wind up with less caffeine in your 16 oz iced coffee than your 16 oz hot coffee.

Actually the dial is temporarily interrupting the electric current flowing down the line as it turns. The rapid pulses it generates in this way indicate to the local exchange what phone number you want to reach. A modern phone uses a different system called tone dialing (also known as DTMF, or dual-tone multi-frequency). As you press the numbers on the keypad, you hear musical notes going down the line instead of clicks. The exchange recognizes the number you want from the musical sounds your handset makes.

Now, calls travel in a whole variety of different ways. Most calls still go from homes to local exchanges along old-style copper wires (arranged in what's called a twisted pair). But calls can travel between exchanges down ultra-fast, high-capacity fiber-optic cables. Longer-distance calls are often beamed between urban centers using microwave towers (like small satellite dishes mounted on high buildings). International calls are typically bounced around the world using space satellites. Fiber-optics, microwave towers, and satellites send and receive phone calls not as electrical signals but as pulses of electromagnetic radiation (light or radio waves) traveling at the speed of light.

The measures are meant to reduce the budget deficit by bringing government revenues closer to expenditures. This reduces the amount of borrowing required and may also demonstrate a government's fiscal discipline to creditors and credit rating agencies and make borrowing easier and cheaper as a result",

This is usually done by hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"). Fracking intentionally causes small earthquakes (magnitudes smaller than 1) to enhance permeability, but it has also been linked to larger earthquakes. The largest earthquake known to be induced by hydraulic fracturing in the United States was a M4 earthquake in Texas. In addition to natural gas, fracking fluids and saltwater trapped in the same formation as the gas are returned to the surface. These wastewaters are frequently disposed of by injection into deep wells. The injection of wastewater and saltwater into the subsurface can also cause earthquakes that are large enough to be damaging. . Wastewater disposal is a \u200bseparate \u200bprocess in which fluid waste from oil and gas production is injected deep underground far below ground water or drinking water aquifers. The largest earthquake known to be induced by wastewater disposal was a M5.8 earthquake that occurred near Pawnee, Oklahoma in 2016.",

When you are cognitively busy, you are focused on each task you are performing, and so you don't have the opportunity to notice the passage of time. As a result, the interval feels like it passes quickly. When you are bored, there is not much to occupy your time, and you are much more likely to think about the passage of time. So time feels like it passes slowly when not much is happening.\n\n\nWhen you look back on time periods, though, things reverse. How can you decide how long a time period was in retrospect?

In the first case, the object on the screen is involuntarily registered as (mildly) potential danger, which leads to elevated arousal levels.

Mechanical processes, such as roasting, chopping and grinding play a role because they disrupt the cell wall of almonds and affect particle size. Particle size is also affected when almonds are chewed and digested in the body. The larger the particle size, the less the almond is broken down by digestive enzymes and the more of the almond is excreted, so fewer calories are absorbed. The reverse is also true: the smaller the particle size, the more calories are absorbed. Further research is needed to better understand the results of this study and how this method of measuring calories could potentially affect the calorie count of other foods.",

There, specialized photoreceptive structures called rods and cones convert these photons into electromagnetic impulses that your brain interprets as shapes, colors, and textures.\n\n\nYour lens changes shape in order to focus on things both near and far. However, there are limits to its flexibility. When something is blurry, it usually means the light being focused by your lens is either under- or overshooting the focal point at the back of your retina (though blurriness can also be caused by physical damage to your eyeball).\n\n\nThe light from the thing you are trying to look at is also competing with light from everything else in your field of view. All this extra light is basically noise, and like static it obscures your desired signal. When you squint, you are reducing the amount of light coming from other sources\u2014stripping some of the noise away.",

At the outset, it is important to note why legalization is preferable to decriminalization. Decriminalization of drug possession simply means that possession is not a criminal offense. In 2001, Portugal decriminalized all drugs, and the public health benefits have been palpable. Under a system of decriminalization, however, the manufacturing and sale of drugs is still criminal. As a result, the drug market is still propped up and supplied by drug cartels, just as it is in a system of prohibition. Legalization goes further than decriminalization by legalizing drug production. Allowing companies to manufacture drugs removes the viability of the black market drug trade, such as in Mexico where one cartel alone \u201chad annual earnings calculated to be as high as $3 billion.\u201d In 2018, the DEA spent over $445 million on international enforcement to decrease the impact of these cartels in the United States.

Moreover, activists maintain that decriminalization will help address the disproportionately high jail time and number of drug-related arrests among Black and brown people. A statewide study found that the new Oregon drug legalization will reduce drug convictions for Black and Native people by nearly 95 percent.

This is related, in part, to evidence that drugs such as marijuana or heroin, which had been previously categorized as having no medicinal value, may have potential medical benefit. These efforts are also premised upon the experiences of countries like Portugal, which decriminalized all illicit drugs in 2001 and reported subsequent decreases in drug-related societal problems, as well as support for legalizing drugs like marijuana for non-medical use in countries such as Canada and Uruguay (Room, 2014; Goncalves et al., 2015; Cox, 2018).

The exception was that persons with no primary substance use had a higher rating on decriminalization of medical marijuana (mean 7.1/10) compared with their other ratings, perhaps because this was the most conservative marijuana option given.

Obviously, this question is not \u201cshould \u2018allah\u2019 should be used in translations of the bible?,\u201d the question is \u201cwhen and where should it be used?\u201d In an Arabic bible translation, \u2018Allah\u2019 is the appropriate word to use when translating the Greek word \u2018theos\u2019 (god), the Aramaic word \u2018elah\u2019 (god), or the Hebrew words \u2018el, eloah, or elohim\u2019 (god). However, in other languages, like Persian, Amharic, French, English, etc\u2026 the word \u2018Allah\u2019 is not a generic noun, it is a proper name.

Speaking to Xbox Senior Hardware Program Manager Gabi Mitchel at a previous event, she described how the Xbox One wireless signal can support up to eight controllers and headsets while maintaining sub 8ms latency. Bluetooth, conversely, can manage around two.\n\n\nAdditionally, Bluetooth is highly susceptible to interference from other devices, due to the way it continually scans for new connections. If you're someone who wears a Bluetooth-enabled watch or uses a Bluetooth-enabled phone, simply being in range of your Xbox would impact the bitrate, and thus responsiveness, of your controls.\n\n\nIf Microsoft leveraged Bluetooth, they would also be forced to conform to specific standards set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which Microsoft can't directly control. The Xbox Wireless signal gives Microsoft far more flexibility, which is why we can now get laptops and headsets with Xbox Wireless baked directly within.",

The chemical process that turns dairy milk into cheese makes it possible for the cheese to be made on a large scale and sold as a commercial product.",

It takes a few hours at the correct temperature for most cheeses to form.\n\n\nOnce the cheese curds are formed, many kinds of cheese are drained, pressed, shaped, and then aged to allow moisture to escape and flavor to develop. During the aging process, exposure to oxygen causes the cheese to create a rind, which is a hard outer layer.\n\n\nRennet is required to make aged cheeses because it contains long protein chains that break down slowly, which allows lactic acid to develop smoky, floral, fruity, and nutty flavors. In cheesemaking, the term \u201cterroir\u201d refers to the process of adding mold cultures, like in bleu cheese, for more variety of flavor.",

Ripening and curing consists of biological and chemical changes that occur in the cheese and are affected by the moisture content, acidity, texture, shape, size, and microorganisms in the cheese. These changes alter the consistency as well as the flavour of the cheese. Before ripening, cheese is said to be fresh or green; after ripening it is called cured, aged, or ripened. The chemical changes may be classified broadly as the breakdown of fats to fatty acids; proteins to amino acids; and lactose to such products as lactic, acetic, and propionic acids, diacetyl, and carbon dioxide.

With regards to binge drinking, if someone drinks alcohol and it makes them feel good, they have fun and relieves them of social anxiety, then they will continue to drink alcohol.

Going on Mathletics (Wayne L.Winston 2009), some sports e.g. the NFL can be governed by a simple least squares algorithm based on margins of victory and points scored which can then be finessed (e.g. to give more weight to recent games). This can then be used to generate win percentages based on the ratings derived. In the case of the NFL, Hal Stern \"On the Probability of Winning an American Football Game\" (American Statistician 45, 1991) showed that the probability of the final margin of victory for home NFL team can be well approximated by a normal random variable with mean = home edge+home team rating-away team rating and a standard deviation of 13.86. Plug the ratings generated by your least squares work in and you have a set of percentages against a given spread. I believe that this can also be applied to a lot of other sports (e.g Australian Rules Football). In the case of football though I believe that oddsmakers also have done some regression analysis into player statistics to allow them to make a more rational rating based on the players that will actually be on the pitch rather than past team performa...",

Even more, the presence of new revenue sources, specifically department stores and other retailers, more than made up for old party subsidies. Yet these new advertisers all but insisted that editors expand their reach, and be less partisan.[ix]\n\n\nSuch considerations drove most, though not all, newspapers to present the news more objectively. Newspapers did not march in lock step, especially in the 1930s, when the Chicago Tribune made no effort to disguise its distaste for Franklin Roosevelt. There were other holdouts, including, for many years, the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\nStill, I would argue that by the 1950s most newspapers, large and small, as well as the broadcast networks, tried to present the news objectivity. What factors, in effect, closed the deal? The relative neutrality of broadcast journalists was explained in large measure by federal regulations that all but mandated fairness. But there are other explanations as to why our national news culture, whether print or broadcast, preferred the middle ground.",

But this isn\u2019t what happens. The Monty Hall problem has a very specific clause: Monty knows where the car is. He never chooses the door with the car. And by curating the remaining doors for you, he raises the odds that switching is always a good bet.",

This is the heart of chaos theory, a set of scientific principles describing highly complex systems, such as weather systems, where small changes in initial conditions radically change the final results.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow meteorologists wonder whether they could put chaos to good use to prevent hurricanes from forming in the first place. If they could change one or two variables just as an Atlantic storm is beginning to coil itself into a monster, maybe they could diminish its strength or divert its path. Changing sea temperatures seems the most likely scenario, and a few scientists have proposed coating the ocean surface with a thin layer of biodegradable oil. This could, in theory, reduce evaporation, the process that drives hurricane formation. Similar ideas could work on tornadoes, as well. One physicist has proposed disrupting funnel-cloud formation by zapping the atmosphere with beams of microwaves shot from solar-powered satellites.",

Rainfall takes place when supercooled water droplets form ice crystals. Then, these become too heavy and cannot remain suspended in the air. Therefore, they fall and more often not, melt to form rain on their way down.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that even in the driest areas there is usually some amount of water in the air. This water can be collected and turned into ice crystals through atmospheric seeding with several chemicals such as dry ice and silver iodide.\n\n\nThese chemicals induce nucleation and promote rainfall.",

There are a few ways in which this can happen.\n\n\nFirst of all, the phase of a material (whether it is gas, liquid, or solid) depends strongly on both its temperature and pressure. For most liquids, applying pressure raises the temperature at which the liquid freezes to solid. A solid is formed when the loose, meandering molecules of a liquid get slow enough and close enough to form stable bonds that pin them in place. When we apply pressure to a liquid, we force the molecules to get closer together. They can therefore form stable bonds and become a solid even if they have a higher temperature than the freezing point at standard pressure.",

Sure enough, it would be its most natural state. But actually if you cool down some very pure, very steady water, you can pretty easily get... a very cold liquid below 0\u00b0C. This is all because in order for the water molecules to re-arrange into Crystal of ice, they need some support to rely on, a little seed to grow around (we call that a nucleus). So if there is no impurity in that water, then you can cool it down without freezing it ! You have to be careful to keep it steady too, because the energy of a shock would give the kick it needs to start the crystallization.",

While differential calculus focuses on rates of change, such as slopes of tangent lines and velocities, integral calculus deals with total size or value, such as lengths, areas, and volumes. The two branches are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which shows how a definite integral is calculated by using its antiderivative (a function whose rate of change, or derivative, equals the function being integrated). For example, integrating a velocity function yields a distance function, which enables the distance traveled by an object over an interval of time to be calculated. As a result, much of integral calculus deals with the derivation of formulas for finding antiderivatives. The great utility of the subject emanates from its use in solving differential equations.",

These emit ultraviolet light at colored spots of phosphor on the screen, which then glow to create the picture.",

However, technology has evolved to greatly improved the contrast of LED TVs, even to the point where it's also as good as what plasma once was. There are two main types of LCD panels in TVs: Vertical Alignment (VA) and In-Plane Switching (IPS). VA panels produce a better contrast than IPS, and high-end TVs also have local dimming features that turn off certain zones of the LED backlights. Still, you won't get a perfect black level, but most modern LED TVs produce such deep blacks that even in a dark environment it looks like perfect black levels. For reference, plasma TVs had a max contrast of about 4,000:1, according to DisplayMate.com, but some recent LED TVs can reach a contrast of over 20,000:1 with local dimming enabled, like the Samsung QN90A QLED.",

Each organism so produced varies, however little, in some measurable way from its relatives. In any given environment at any given time, those variants best suited to that environment will tend to leave more offspring than the others. Offspring resemble their ancestors. Variant organisms will leave offspring like themselves. Therefore, organisms will diverge from their ancestors with time. The term natural selection is shorthand for saying that all organisms do not survive to leave offspring with the same probability. Those alive today have been selected relative to similar ones that never survived or procreated.

Natural selection was the fundamental concept in his explanation. Natural selection occurs because individuals having more-useful traits, such as more-acute vision or swifter legs, survive better and produce more progeny than individuals with less-favourable traits. Genetics, a science born in the 20th century, reveals in detail how natural selection works and led to the development of the modern theory of evolution. Beginning in the 1960s, a related scientific discipline, molecular biology, enormously advanced knowledge of biological evolution and made it possible to investigate detailed problems that had seemed completely out of reach only a short time previously\u2014for example, how similar the genes of humans and chimpanzees might be (they differ in about 1\u20132 percent of the units that make up the genes).",

Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a \u03c3-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p_z+p_z, s+p_z and d z^2+d z^2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).[2] Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and p_z+p_z molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative energies of the MOs of like symmetry.",

Many of these people could not find themselves in a society that was alien to them. Some of those individuals saddled motorcycles, dressed in black leather and started decorating their steel horses with trophy swastikas and iron crosses as a protest against the government. Soon they began to unite in motorcycle clubs and live by the old front principles. Since then, the Iron Cross has taken a new place in history. It became one of the main symbols of bikers and motorcycle customizers around the world. You can find crosses in many elements of biker culture, from the colors to cross rings, pendants and other jewelry.

So the signal that your stereo receives is exactly the same signal that your iPhone is creating.\n\n\nUSB on the other hand sends unprocessed or raw music files directly to the head unit\u2019s DAC. The head unit is then responsible for decoding/processing the song data into an audio signal.\n\n\nTo make it bit more easier to understand, think of it as the USB cable transferring data like you would to a computer and the Aux cable transferring an audio signal to your headphones.",

(Image credit: Ice image via <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shutterstock</a>)\n\n\nCurious children, and adults with lots of free time on their hands, often notice that apparently clear water sometimes produces oddly clouded ice cubes. The main reason is that the (hopefully) crystal-clear water you pour into the ice trays is not as pure as it seems, containing small amounts of (hopefully) harmless suspended minerals and sediment.\n\n\nBecause all objects freeze from the outside in, the center of the cube is the last to solidify. Water free of minerals and impurities freezes first, pushing the cloudy parts containing the sediment (and tiny trapped air bubbles) toward the center. The result is a harmless (but not particularly photogenic) ice cube clouding.",

When the water flows from your tap, it tends to be pretty well oxygenated also.\n\n\nAs the water freezes, it wants to form a regular crystalline structure (ice). That means impurities like oxygen and other dissolved gasses are pushed away from the crystallization front into the remaining liquid. This means that the last parts of the ice cube to crystallize end up with most of the impurities. If you\u2019ll take a look at your home made ice cubes, you\u2019ll note that the parts of the ice cube that were at the bottom of the tray are the milky colored bits. That\u2019s because those were the last parts to freeze.

The Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Birds flying south for the winter can stay on track by using the Sun's position in the sky throughout the day as a guide.\n\n\nOf course, once the Sun sets, it isn't much help as a guide. Luckily, many birds can also navigate by the position of the stars in the sky once night rolls around. Constellations guided many sailors at night before modern technology came along. Birds can use the stars as navigational aids in the same way.\n\n\nBirds also have the benefit of a bird's eye view. Human hikers lost in the woods sometimes must climb to the top of the nearest mountain to be able to see natural or man-made landscape features, like roads or coastlines, to find their way home.

One of their methods is to try and avoid turning through oncoming traffic at a junction. Although this might be going in the opposite direction of the final destination, it reduces the chances of an accident and cuts delays caused by waiting for a gap in the traffic, which would also waste fuel.\n\nUPS have designed their vehicle routing software to eliminate as many left-hand turns as possible (in countries with right-hand traffic). Typically, only 10% of the turns are left turns. As a result, the company claims it uses 10 million gallons less fuel, emits 20,000 tonnes (22,000 tons) less carbon dioxide, and delivers 350,000 more packages every year. The efficiency of planning routes with its navigation software this way has even helped the firm cut the number of trucks it uses by 1,100, bringing down the company\u2019s total distance travelled by 28.5 million miles\u2014despite the longer routes.",

By guiding drivers to avoid left turns whenever possible, Orion has cut the average UPS route by 6 to 8 miles, saving the delivery behemoth some $300 to $400 million each year in gas, salaries and vehicle upkeep.",

From a report: The company decided on eliminating left turns (or right turns in left-hand driving countries such as India) wherever possible after it found that drivers have to sit idly in the trucks while waiting to take the left turn to pass through traffic. So, it created an algorithm that eliminated left turns from drivers' routes even if meant a longer journey. This meant that drivers do not have to wait in traffic to take a left turn and can take the right turn at junctions. Of course, the algorithm does not entirely eliminate left turns, but the number of left turns taken by UPS trucks is less than 10 percent of all turns made. Turns out that UPS was right -- the idea really paid off. In 2005, a year after it announced that it will minimize left turns, the company said that the total distance covered by its 96,000 trucks was reduced by 747,000km, and 190,000 litres of fuel had been saved.

Within the shoot apical meristem the plant cells divide and begin to differentiate into different cell types (such as different cells of the leaf, or vascular cells). Later growth (of, say, a leaf) is largely a result of cell expansion (although cell division does still occur, but drops off as the leaf expands). Therefore, if you punch a hole in a leaf, it probably won't be filled in because the cells in that leaf have finished growing and dividing.",

Different plants obviously make different numbers of branches, but there is a common control mechanism known as apical dominance, where the meristem at the tip of the shoot suppresses the growth of the lower axillary buds. This is why a shoot with no branches can be made to grow branches by cutting off the tip (gardeners often do this to make \"leggy\" plants more bushy).\n\n\nAll of that was a long explanation to say, no, a plant doesn't normally^^ regenerate in the sense of filling in cells that have gone missing. However, if you cut off a shoot, the next remaining bud might begin to grow and, in a sense, replace the part that was lost. In that case, an existing bud is recruited to form a new branch and replace lost functionality, but I wouldn't say that qualifies as regenerating missing tissue.",

Abscission layers may also form when leaves are seriously damaged by insects, disease, or drought. As a result, a zone of cells across the petiole becomes softened until the leaf falls.

Native Americans, on the other hand, were largely hunters and gatherers, and even in some domestication cases, it\u2019s thought exposure was limited.",

As contact with whites grew more frequent, Indians became exposed to germs and pathogens for which they had no immunity, and as a result they suffered sickness and mortality rates much higher than whites. Scholars estimate that the American Indian population (within contemporary U.S. boundaries) declined from about 600,000 in 1800 to a mere 250,000 by 1900. Besides leaving tribes numerically ill prepared to resist white encroachment, imported diseases struck hardest at elders who filled important leadership roles in Indian societies. Native Americans increasingly blamed these losses on white intrusion while many whites believed that Indians were a dying race destined for extinction. Thus disease exacerbated tensions between whites and natives and made peaceful co-existence far more difficult.",

Sometimes the illnesses spread through direct contact with colonists. Other times, they were transmitted as Indians traded with one another.

Though many epidemics happened prior to the colonial era in the 1500s, several large epidemics occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries among various Native American populations.

At the beginning of an action, such as singing a song or taking a step, the switch closes to indicate the start of timing; then, the number of impulses from the pacemaker are recorded by the accumulator. The longer the switch remains closed, the more impulses are recorded by the accumulator. The amount of impulses can then be used to represent how much time has passed during the interval, which can in turn inform when to take the next action.",

Studies recording electrical brain activity in animals have shown that neurons in the hippocampus signal particular moments in time. But the hippocampus isn\u2019t always necessary for tracking time. Remarkably, people with damage to their hippocampus can accurately remember the passage of short time periods, but are impaired at remembering long time intervals.

While many squatters are routinely evicted, arrested, harassed, or even, in some parts of the world, beaten or killed, some manage to make comfortable long-term homes on another person's property. A few are even able to take legal possession of their adopted digs through a process called \u201cadverse possession\u201d. Whether you're unemployed, underpaid, or just extraordinarily thrifty, squatting may be the solution to your housing needs. However, be aware that in the vast majority of cases squatting will disqualify you from adverse possession, and it can result in you getting taken to court or being arrested.",

As you look for an abandoned property to move into, try to find a place that was seized from an owner and is now in the government\u2019s possession. This makes it less likely that an owner will visit and find you. Beware of buildings with serious structural damage, as this could be dangerous to you and anyone squatting with you. Once you\u2019ve found a safe and empty spot, improve the building by replacing or boarding up windows, cleaning out pests, and patching walls. If possible, get the utilities reconnected. Making the space habitable will not only improve your living conditions, but it will help you claim ownership if someone tries to evict you.
